This website is my first one where i applied **Backend technologies** like MongoDB - Express - NodeJS.<br/>
In the **Frontend development** i used React and Redux for the state.<br/>
For **styling** and organizing all the CSS i choosed the Sass preprocessor. Also the MaterialUI library was used for some responsive components.

[**React hook form**](https://react-hook-form.com/ 'React Hook Form website') was used to handle errors on the "Sell a Car" page and for the Firebase authentication form.

## Firebase

I used the Firebase service to implement **User Authentication** on the website.<br/>
Also **Firebase hosting** was used to... well.

## Image storing on the cloud.

And for posting and receiving the car images i used [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/ 'Cloudinary website') service.

> At first a system for posting and receiving images was made using only [Multer](https://github.com/expressjs/multer 'Multer website') where the images were stored in a private file on my workspace, but i wanted to improve as this method has some cons in the long run.

### About functionality

The user can select a car which he likes most, he click on the "Buy this car" button and the delete method is triggered.<br/>
Also the part i like the most is when you want to sell a car and all the process that is shown until the car is finally uploaded with all it's description and image.
